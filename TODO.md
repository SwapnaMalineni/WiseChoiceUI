# Layout and Spacing Improvements

## Tasks to Complete

- [ ] Update padding on major sections (hero, features, about, about-page, partners, testimonials, pricing, contact, footer) to increase vertical spacing for less crowded content.
- [ ] Adjust .container width for better mobile responsiveness (reduce to 95% on small screens).
- [ ] Ensure grid layouts adapt properly by reviewing and updating media queries if needed.
- [ ] Test responsiveness on different screen sizes (manual testing required since browser tool is disabled).
